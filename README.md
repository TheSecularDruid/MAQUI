# MAQUI: Interweaving Queries and Pattern Mining for Recursive Event Sequence Exploration

MAQUI is web application that supports expressive querying and flexible pattern mining for exploring event sequence data. It is a collaborative effort between researchers at Georgia Tech and Adobe Research. For more information about the project, please refer to our paper at IEEE VIS 2018:

## System Demo

[This video](https://youtu.be/17jqGbyWm2w) walks you through the basic funcationality of MAQUI. [This video](https://youtu.be/UhlBhDrejK0) demonstrates how MAQUI can be used for exploring the [Foursquare dataset](https://sites.google.com/site/yangdingqi/home/foursquare-dataset).

## Running the System

You need to install Python3, Java, and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) in order to run the system. Chrome is recommended as the system was only tested with Chrome.

The following are the instructions and commands to run the system using a Mac:

1. Clone the repository using Terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/terrancelaw/MAQUI.git
```

2. Go to the folder named "MAQUI".

```
cd MAQUI
```

3. Go to the folder named "server".

```
cd server
```

4. Start the Python server (you need Python3 for the system to work properly).

```
python server.py
```

5. Visit http://localhost:5000/ using Chrome.
